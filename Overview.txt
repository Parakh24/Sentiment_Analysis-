# Goal : In this case study , we will focus only on rating , review attribute to develop a sentiment analyzer model to categorize 
# review either positive or negative 

# 1. Map rating with 1 to 10 to binary classes (positive or negative) 
#. Try to solve real time challenges related to Sentiment Analyzer : Sarcasm , multi polarity and negation 
# Develop NLP and ML model to categorize English text reviews either positive or negative 
# Deploy Sentiment Analyzer model on AWS cloud using rest API 


# Map Ratings range to Binary classes: 
  # 1 to 4: Negative 
  # 5 to 6: Neutral 
  # 7 to 10: Positive 

#As we are interested in Positive and Negative reviews only , we will filter out Neutral reviews from the dataset 


#Final Outcome : 
  #1. Sentiment Value for each review either Positive or Negative
  #2 Movie attribute like by majoriry of users
  #3 Movie attribute disliked by majority of users  



# Chalenges while dveloping sentiment analyzer model: 
  # Sarcasm : some time user provide their negative review by using positive words. Simple Sentiment analysis model can 
              # easily fool by this kind of sarcasm. SO, we need to design our sentiment analyzer model in such a way that it  
              # can handle sarcasm also. 
  
  #Polarity : Sometime user provide multipolarity review than traditional sentiment analyzer system may not work. So, we need to 
              # design sentiment analyzer to get valuable information form multipolarity reviews also. 

  # Negation : Some user use non,  less , not , never , cannot to reverse , the polarity of review or word. SO, we need to use state 
               # of the art ML model to handle this kind of scenarios.
